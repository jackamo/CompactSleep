# CompactSleep
Simple, no fuss Bed system for larger Minecraft servers. CompactSleep allows for a configurable amount of users to be in bed to trigger a new day, relieving other users from having to either log out or head to their own bed.

This mod takes ideas from both [BetterBeds](https://github.com/Phoenix616/BetterBeds) and [SinglePlayerSleep](https://github.com/JoelGodOfwar/SinglePlayerSleep), but doesn't require any extra permission systems or any fancy-pants stuff that you don't need from a bed plugin.

Built for my friends at [CompactCraft](http://reddit.com/r/CompactCraft).

# Download and Installation
**Note:** This mod requires Spigot for Minecraft 1.11. Well, maybe it'll work on others? But it has only been tested on v1.11.

You can download this mod from [the releases page](https://github.com/jackamo/CompactSleep/releases). Just plop the mod into your plugins folder, and you're away laughing.

# Usage
There are only two commands
 * **`/csreload`**: Reloads the `config.yml` configuration file.
 * **`/cscancel`**: Requests a cancel from sleeping. You shouldn't have to use this, and instead you can just click the `[CANCEL]` link in chat when a user enters their bed. This command is what is called when that link is clicked.
